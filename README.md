#Implementation of BLUE AQM in ns-3

Course Code: CS822

Assignment: #FP1

Overview: 

BLUE uses packet loss and link idle events to manage congestion. This project will show us BLUE is performing well compare to Random Early Detection (RED) [2] in terms of packet loss rate and buffer size requirement in the network through ns-3 [3] simulation.
